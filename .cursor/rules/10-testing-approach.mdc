Description: Testing strategy and patterns (when tests are added)
Globs: **/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}

# Testing Approach

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for hooks and utilities
- Integration tests for module interactions
- E2E tests for critical flows (room creation, code sync)
- Firebase emulator for Firestore rules testing

## Test Structure
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Co-locate tests with source or in `__tests__/` directory
- Use descriptive test names: `describe('useAuth', () => { it('should sign in user', ...) })`

## Testing Tools (Future)
- Vitest for unit/integration tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- Firebase emulator for Firestore testing

## Testing Patterns

### Hook Testing
```typescript
describe('useAuth', () => {
  it('should return user when authenticated', () => {
    // Test hook behavior
  })
})
```

### Component Testing
```typescript
describe('RoomCard', () => {
  it('should display room name', () => {
    render(<RoomCard room={mockRoom} />)
    // Assertions
  })
})
```

## Mocking
- Mock Firebase/Liveblocks/Daily in tests
- Use test doubles for external services
- Mock TanStack Query when needed
- Keep mocks simple and focused

## Coverage Goals (Future)
- Aim for 80%+ coverage on critical paths
- Focus on business logic, not implementation details
- Test user-facing behavior, not internal APIs

## Note
Tests will be added in later epics. This rule establishes the testing approach for when tests are implemented.
